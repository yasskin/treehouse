Why does UX exist in the first place?

The Foundation of UX2:38
Now that we’ve learned a bit of background on UX and its brief history, let’s build forth starting with understanding the foundation of UX: User Centered Design.

User-Centered Design UCD since 70s

Needs wants of end-user are given

Who are the users?
What are their tasks and goals?
What are the users' experience levels?
What functions or information do users need?

Participatory design - all stakeholders are included

The Persona. A behavioral representation of a user type. Only a tool.

UCD focuses on the persona and scenario-based design (stories). Empathy and include users.

UCD process. Utilized in field of UX.

The Importance of UX2:18
Now that we understand a bit about User Centered Design, we should talk about why UX is important to creating products and services.

Age of Experience.
Holistic User Experience. Invisible, Cultural, Multidisciplinary, Holistic. Supports a cause and
Extends beyond the interface of a product. Same message everywhere.

Understand the whole.

UX Disciplines 3:53
In this video, we'll break down many of the different disciplines that make up user experience design.

many disciplines:
- visual design (aesthetic visual narrative/consistency)
- information architecture - uses information to create a structure for user experience / navigation or information flow
- content strategy -
- interaction design - defines interaction model or narrative / ensures interaction is consistent
- usability - flows, interfaces, products, stays true
- user research - user behavior

UX in world of design - extends into other

UX is between industrial design and interface design.
bridge the gap between hardware and software.
UX is made up of pieces and parts.

The Backgrounds of Great UX Designers 2:38
In this video, we’ll talk about the backgrounds that great UX Designers come from, and what backgrounds make it easier to become a successful UX Designer.

UX can come from many fields.
Many great UX ers come from visual design.
Understanding tech and software development also helps.
Front End Development. Creating interfaces products services. Understand digital products. Research and usability.
Back End Development. Understand technology and process structure and complexity.
Library Sciences. Information architecture.

Problem Solvers 4:24
In this video, we'll cover why we should think of the UX Designer less as a designer, and more of a great problem solver.

Why?
Identify the real problem first.

How will my success be defined?
Will this solution have to lead to another?
Are there other project that could influence mine?
Get to the pain points.

Information Architecture for the World Wide Web. The Polar Bear book.

Understand the User. Puts the user at the center. Gain insights into the goals needs tasks of the user.

Identify the specific users.
Demographics.
Behaviors over demographics.

Understanding the content is an important piece.

Understanding Users and Content 6:47
In this video, we'll learn about the first two steps in being a great problem solver: understanding the user and understanding the content.

Understanding Context 3:59
UXers next need a way to govern which content and information the user should see in order to help facilitate their ideal experience with our product. This is where we use our good friend, context.

Context.
What environment is the user in.
Is our product a mobile application.
Do they have a bad wifi connection.

User research phase.
Context in the details.
Extract an empathetic point of view.
Decrease the users cognitive load, so that their anxiety is lessened.
Context is key. Where. When. How. Predict what information they need and when.

Modeling, Testing and Executing the Experience 3:45
with Lis Hubert
Up to this point, this entire process has been somewhat conceptual. So what do UXers do to showcase their thinking regarding the solution? After coming up with the conceptual solution, we move into modeling that solution in order to show it to others.

"low anxiety, high delight experience"

modeling the solution.
wireframes spec documents
interface is not the solution.

process can be done formally in a lab or informally.

solution meets expectations and needs.

UX Careers 5:06
UXers can work in all different types of companies. In this video, we'll break the types down into four discrete options.

Work with business product design

communicate with technology design team treehouse

Thinking Big in Order to Think Small 3:58
The first step we need to learn is the UXer's ability to think big in order to think small.

Big picture thinker and really small at the same time.
Embrace systems thinking.
General Systems Theory. Catch all for process of understanding how systems behave and influence each other.
User experience - one with a system.

Approach experience you are designing for as a system.

We have to think about the city before we can think about a road.

Think big to think small.

Empathy. The feeling that you understand another person's experience and emotions. We do user research in order to curate talents to share other's feelings. Be in the users shoes. We look out for needs t

We are the user advocate. Your job is to think about the user. How does the requirement help user reach goals, fulfill needs etc.

Ensure user is considered at each stage. You as UXer should think user first.
User first! Key to UCD practices.

We're All Users
We've been talking a lot about User Experience, User Centered Design, User First, etc... But all of this talk begs the question: "what and who is a User?".

End user is not the only user. Everyone should be considered a user.
Solution is nothing.
In most cases, UXers are working within companies.
Business person is also your user.
UX professionals do not code entire service.
Need working relationships with coders and builders.
Anyone you work with is a user.
It is your role to focus beyond goals and tasks.

Everything is Content 4:09
If everyone is our user, we can say that every piece of information is content.

UX is Everywhere 4:31
with Lis Hubert
As we begin our UX journey we'll notice that how we view the world will change, because the the skills and thinking style that we curate as we dive deeper into this profession really can be used, and ignited anywhere, at anytime.

Communication3:15
Now it's time for us to talk about the tools we use to get our job done. The first tool, and perhaps the most important tool, is communication. To be a great UXer you MUST be a great communicator.

Tools for Understanding Users 4:48
In our UX career, it helps to know tools that will help us gain understanding of our users, the content and the context. In this video, we’re going to talk about those tools for understanding our users.

Tools can execute a method. Method would be user interview. Tool would be audio recording.

Correct method, time, user.

Tools for Understanding Content and Context 2:42
Besides tools for understanding users, UXers have a ton of tools to understand content and context. In fact, many of them are the same tools!

Strategic UX 2:47
Moving into strategic UX means embracing our principles in a new way. Instead of understanding users, content and context at a project level, we see it at an organizational or strategic level.

The Business of UX 1:56
Business and technology partners play a huge role in our UX lives, but these are also the people that it’s extra hard to prove our value to.

Proving the Value of UX 3:04
As a UX not only are you in the business of designing great user experiences, you're also in the business of proving your value.

Where Do We Go From Here? 2:22

Hopefully you have taken away a high level overview of the history and purpose behind User Experience Design, the way that UXers think and the type of work they do, the tools that are involved in UX and of course UX beyond just the tactical interface driven world. But you may be asking yourself: Where do I go from here?
