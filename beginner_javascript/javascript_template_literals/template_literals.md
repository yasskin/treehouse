Template literals are very similar to string literals, but they use backticks (\`) instead of single quotes (') or double quotes (").

Interpolation 4:08

Template literals get their name from their ability to evaluate expressions. Think of a form letter template with blanks to hold names or numbers that can be filled in later: "Dear ______, Thank you for your business on ______! Sincerely, Management" Similarly, values can be filled, or interpolated, into template literals, to be evaluated when the program runs. Let's get a feel for how this works.

```
${name}
```
