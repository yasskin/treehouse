# The Language of Programming 5:11
## with Andrew Chalkley, Dave McFarland, and Joel Kraft

## Learn basic concepts shared by all programming languages — values, variables, functions and control structures. Learn how changing values can change how a program works by experimenting with a JavaScript game.

* Syntax — a programming languages vocabulary and grammar. Every programming language has its own syntax. For example, JavaScript has special keywords like var, if, and function that all do different things to in a program.

* Values — the data in your program. For example, a number like 375 is a numeric value; a logical value like true, or false is called a boolean value; and a collection of letters inside of quote marks are called a string: 'Hello there!'.

* Variables — variables hold values. They are like boxes you store information in like the current score in a game, or the name of the player. For example, to create a variable and store a number 0 in it, you could write this JavaScript code: var currentScore = 0

* Control structures — control the flow of the program: what happens and when it happens. For example, if you're playing a game and your character dies, the game ends. The flow of the program is controlled by actions that happen in the program.

* Commands (functions) — the commands we ask a program to complete, like adding two numbers together or validating a person's email address.

# Doing Things With Functions6:15
## with Andrew Chalkley, Dave McFarland, and Joel Kraft

## Commands, or functions, are the basic building blocks of a program. A function lets you define specific steps a computer should take. You then make the computer perform those steps by "calling" the function. Learn about functions while adding to a JavaScript game.

## Using Functions

1. Create or "declare" a function. This stores the steps of the function in memory. The function doesn't activate, but the computer remembers what to do:
```
function add(x, y) {
alert( x + y);
}
```
2. "Call" a function. Make the function do something by calling it by name and giving it some information:
```
add(2, 3);
```
This will make an alert box open in your browser with the number 5 in it.
