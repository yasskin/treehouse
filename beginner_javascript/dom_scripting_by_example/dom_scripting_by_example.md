# DOM Scripting By Example
114-minute JavaScript Course

## About this Course

Use JavaScript to build an RSVP web application. Many of the features you'll build are common to other web applications. When you're done programing the app, you'll have the basics you will need to build any client-side web app.

What you'll learn
* DOM element selection
* DOM traversal
* DOM manipulation
* Event handling

# Adding and Removing Names
* Let's start by looking at the RSVP application we want to build, and implementing some basic features.

# Editing and Filtering Names
* Let's give users a way to modify names in our app. Let's also let them filter names, so they can see confirmed guests at a glance.

# Improving the Application Code
* Now that we've pieced together a working app, let's go back in and tidy up our code. This will make it easier to modify later if need be.
