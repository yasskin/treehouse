# SQL Basics

## About this Course

In SQL Basics weâ€™ll take a look at what databases are and how you can retrieve information from them. Databases can store massive amounts of information to be retrieved at a later date. Databases act as the memory for dynamic web sites or mobile apps.
Data, Databases and SQL

## We'll take a look at databases, the types of structures inside them, what data is and what SQL is.

Why This Course?

## Data is Everywhere

In this video we'll discuss what data and databases are and review some real world applications for database.

## Talking to Databases with SQL

In order to communicate with a database, you've got to speak it's language. SQL is a specialized programming language used for interacting with databases for example, reading information from a database.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL has been around since the 1970s!

Reading data from a database is known as querying.

## Organizing Data with Databases

Databases allow users to store data in well defined sections. This keeps the data uniform. However, the SQL you write can show the data in different ways which is handy for reporting subsets of data.

* Schema
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema

Rows and Columns
Tables contain rows and columns
Each table contains one type of thing

Each entry in a table is known as a row.

## Types of Data

There are good reasons why your data should be categorized in to different types. In this video we'll explore some of them.

Types of Data

Here's a slightly larger list of data types than in the video.

Text Type Examples
* TEXT
* VARCHAR

Numeric Type Examples
* INT
* INTEGER

Date Type Examples
* DATETIME
* DATE
* TIMESTAMP

Here's documentation sites for some other databases where you can see the similarities and differences in data types.

* MySQL Data Types
* SQLite Data Types
* PostgreSQL Data Types
* Microsoft SQL Data Types: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql

## Data, Databases and SQL Review

## Getting Data from a Database

Reading information is the most common operation performed on a database. Whether you're a Business Analyst, Web Developer or Mobile App developer reading from databases is a must have skill.

## Tools We'll be Using

In this video we'll look at some different tools that you may use in a professional setting and what you'll use while learning here, SQL Playgrounds.

Different Database Tools

* Mode Analytics used for businesses to get insights from their database. https://modeanalytics.com/
* pgAdmin for PostgreSQL https://www.pgadmin.org/
* phpMyAdmin https://www.phpmyadmin.net/  and MySQL Workbench http://mysqlworkbench.org/ for MySQL

## Your First SQL Statement

In this video you'll learn how to write your first SQL query: retrieving all information from one table.

Definitions:

* Syntax The vocabulary and grammatical rules surrounding the structure of your code.

* Keywords The vocabulary words of a programming language used to issue commands to a computer.

SQL Used
```
SELECT * FROM <table name>;
```
* The asterisk or star symbol (\*) means all columns.

* The semi-colon (\;) terminates the statement like a period in sentence or question mark in a question.

Examples:
```
SELECT * FROM books;
SELECT * FROM products;
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM countries;
```

## Selecting All Information From a Table


## Retrieving Specific Columns of Information

You don't have to retrieve all the information from a table. You can retrieve only the information you want from the columns you want and filter out the rest.

SQL Used

Retrieving a single column:

SELECT <column name> FROM <table name>;

Examples:
```
SELECT email FROM users;
SELECT first_name FROM users;
SELECT name FROM products;
SELECT zip_code FROM addresses;
```

Retrieving multiple columns:
```
SELECT <column name 1>, <column name 2>, ... FROM <table name>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers;
SELECT name, description, price FROM products;
SELECT title, author, isbn, year_released FROM books;
SELECT name, species, legs FROM pets;
See all of the SQL used in SQL Basics in the SQL Basics Cheat Sheet.
```

## Categorizing Your Output with 'AS'

You're not restricted to displaying the column names from the table at the top of your results. You can specify your own names for result sets.

SQL Used
```
SELECT <column name> AS <alias> FROM <table name>;
SELECT <column name> <alias> FROM <table name>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT username AS Username, first_name AS "First Name" FROM users;
SELECT title AS Title, year AS "Year Released" FROM movies;
SELECT name AS Name, description AS Description, price AS "Current Price" FROM products;
SELECT name Name, description Description, price "Current Price" FROM products;
```

## Review & Practice with SQL Playgrounds

In this video we'll review some of the concepts that we've covered in this stage and cover what you'll need to do to in your practice session.

## Getting Data From a Database Review


## Finding the Data You Want

Instead of getting all the information back at once isn't always what you want. Finding the information want by writing specialized SQL queries is the way to do it.

## Searching Tables with 'WHERE'

The real power of SQL comes from filtering rows of information. You've filtered columns, now you're going to filter rows.

SQL Used

* A WHERE Clause

SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;
Equality Operator

Find all rows that a given value matches a column's value.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> = <value>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name = "Andrew";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name = "Chalkley";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count = 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published = 1999;
```

* Inequality Operator

Find all rows that a given value doesn't match a column's value.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> != <value>;
```

The not equal to or inequality operator can be written in two ways != and <>. The latter is less common.

Examples:
```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name != "Kenneth";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name != "L:one";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count != 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published != 2015;
```

## Filtering by Comparing Values

You don't need to just search for equal or unequal values. You can compare them to a value you decide.

Relational Operators

There are several relational operators you can use:

* < less than
* <= less than or equal to
* \> greater than
* \>= greater than or equal to

These are primarily used to compare numeric and date/time types.

SQL Used
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> < <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> <= <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> > <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> >= <value>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE date_of_birth < '1998-12-01';
SELECT title AS "Book Title", author AS Author FROM books WHERE year_released <= 2015;
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE price > 9.99;
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE release_year >= 2000;
```

## Filtering on More than One Condition

You're not restricted to just using one condition, you can test rows of information against multiple conditions. You can choose whether you retrieve rows that match both of your conditions or either of them.

SQL Used

You can compare multiple values in a WHERE condition. If you want to test that both conditions are true use the AND keyword, or either conditions are true use the OR keyword.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> AND <condition 2> ...;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> OR <condition 2> ...;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE last_name = "Chalkley" AND first_name = "Andrew";

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = "Games Consoles" AND price < 400;

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title = "The Matrix" OR title = "The Matrix Reloaded" OR title = "The Matrix Revolutions";

SELECT country FROM countries WHERE population < 1000000 OR population > 100000000;
```

## Filtering by Dates

Filtering results by date can be handy for finding entries before or after a specific date. In this video we'll explore filtering by dates.

Relational Operators

There are several relational operators you can use:

* < less than
* <= less than or equal to
* \> greater than
* \>= greater than or equal to

These are primarily used to compare numeric and date/time types.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> < <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> <= <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> > <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> >= <value>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE date_of_birth < '1998-12-01';
SELECT title AS "Book Title", author AS Author FROM books WHERE year_released <= 2015;
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE price > 9.99;
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE release_year >= 2000;
```

## Searching Within a Set of Values

Writing multiple conditions could could lead to typos and possible errors in our reporting. In this video we'll take a look at a short hand syntax.

SQL Used
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);
```
Examples:
```
SELECT name FROM islands WHERE id IN (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category IN ("eBooks", "Books", "Comics");
SELECT title FROM courses WHERE topic IN ("JavaScript", "Databases", "CSS");
SELECT * FROM campaigns WHERE medium IN ("email", "blog", "ppc");
```
To find all rows that are not in the set of values you can use NOT IN.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column>  NOT IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);
```
Examples:
```
SELECT answer FROM answers WHERE id IN (7, 42);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category NOT IN ("Electronics");
SELECT title FROM courses WHERE topic NOT IN ("SQL", "NoSQL");
```
## Searching Within a Range of Values

Again, writing shorter queries can help with readability and tracking down mistakes in our SQL code. In this video we'll go over the syntax of handling ranges of values in SQL.

SQL Used
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> BETWEEN <lesser value> AND <greater value>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 9.99 AND 19.99;
SELECT name, appointment_date FROM appointments WHERE appointment_date BETWEEN "2015-01-01" AND "2015-01-07";
```

## Finding Data that Matches a Pattern

You don't have to be that specific when searching a database table. You can use patterns of characters to help find those trickier bits of data you're trying to track down.

SQL Used

Placing the percent symbol (%) any where in a string in conjunction with the LIKE keyword will operate as a wildcard. Meaning it can be substituted by any number of characters, including zero!
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> LIKE <pattern>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE "Harry Potter%Fire";
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE title LIKE "Alien%";
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name LIKE "%drew";
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE "%Brief History%";
```
PostgreSQL Specific Keywords

LIKE in PostgreSQL is case-sensitive. To case-insensitive searches do ILIKE.
```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name ILIKE "%drew";
```

## Filtering Out or Finding Missing Information

Sometimes you don't have all the information filled out in a row. Whether that's by the design of your database or because someone failed to enter anything, it can be handy to retrieve rows with or without information missing.

NULL must be used with the IS keyword. It cannot be used with the equality operator = ;

IS NOT NULL;
