# Querying Relational Databases
## 145-minute Databases Course

## About this Course
Building off of previous SQL courses, this course will begin to introduce the student to more complex database concepts. Students will learn to think about data as sets and subsets and practice achieving desired query results via such operations as inner and outer joins, unions and except. They will also be introduced to the concepts of Set Theory and Database Normalization to aid in understanding good query practices.

## What you'll learn
1. What is a Relational Database?
2. Database Normalization
3. Database Keys
4. Table Relationships
5. Set Operations


## Database Normalization
In this stage, we will explore what a relational database is, why we structure databases in this way, and talk a little bit about the benefits relational databases. 7 steps

### Why We Make Databases "Relational" 2:31

### Database Normalization 1:33

### How Normalization Helps Us 2:54

### Database Normalization Review 5 questions

### Set Theory and Relational Databases 4:36

### Theoretical Groundwork 0:54

### Set Theory Review 5 questions

## Database Keys
In this stage, we introduce the concept of "Keys." Without Keys, databases as we know them would not be able to function. 5 steps

### Unique Keys 2:06

### Primary Keys 1:59

### Database Keys Review 4 questions

### Foreign Keys 4:36

### Foreign Keys Review 5 questions

## Table Relationships
Relationships in databases help us to describe the way that one tables links or relates to another. 5 steps

### One to Many Relationships 1:38

### Many to Many Relationships 2:16

### One to One Relationships 2:03

### Modeling Table Relationships 2:26

### Table Relationships Review 5 questions

## Joining Table Data with SQL
We will be transitioning from mostly theoretical concepts to hands-on application of the concepts weâ€™ve covered in the previous three stages. We will see how to use table relationships to produce query results that combine data from multiple tables. 6 steps

### Join Queries 1:47

### Inner Joins 5:44

### Outer Joins 4:14

### Review: Table Joins 7 questions

### Review and Practice 2:03

### JOIN Queries 5 objectives

## Set Operations
We cover more SQL operations that allow us to combine data sets from multiple tables in various ways. 8 steps

### What are Set Operations? 0:59

### Union Operations 4:40

### Union All Operations 1:51

### Intersect Operations 2:31

### Except Operations 2:37

### Set Operations Review 5 questions

### Review and Practice 2:02

### Set Operations 6 objectives

### Subqueries
We introduce the you to Subqueries. Subqueries are a powerful tool that allow us to work with data in smaller subsets, which can greatly increase query performance and efficiency. 7 steps

### What are Subqueries? 1:12

### Using IN with Subqueries to Filter Data 2:11

### Using a Subquery to Create a Temporary Table (Part 1) 3:18

### Using a Subquery to Create a Temporary Table (Part 2) 5:33

### Subqueries Review 5 questions

### Review and Practice 2:06

### Subqueries 4 objectives
