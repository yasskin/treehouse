## Introduction to Brand Identity
This stage is an introduction to the course. We will consider the branding process through the lens of a journalist: the who, what, when, where, why and hows of branding.

### The Five Ws and an H 1:54

A good way to begin the brand process is to observe it through the lens of a journalist: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Establishing these circumstances as questions can help us develop an understanding of how to help our clients with their project.

### What is Branding? 3:40

Branding brings about awareness of a company, product, or service. In this video, we'll talk about the main components used to establish a brand.

Brand

Senses

### What is the Value? 1:58
How much should we charge for a brand identity system? Value is subjective and actual dollar amounts are very objective. So let's go over what we'll need to consider when determining the value of our work.

### Why branding? 1:37
In this video, we'll cover the three general types of brand identity designs.

### Who Brands? 1:39
The designer is responsible for determining color, typography and designing the logo. However, sometimes having a product or service on the market opens the door for the public to label or nickname something.

### Brand Story 2:04
In the Brand Story stage, we are still getting to know our client. As we move forward with a brand project, we shouldn't be working for our client. Instead, we should be working with our client.

Questionnaire:
1. What does your organization do?
2.
3.
4. Discovery Interview Questions

### Brand Strategy 2:41
Now we need to collect and aggregate all the information from the Brand Story stage and compile it into a unique document. We call this the Brand Strategy document.

### Brand Development: Design 5:04
Now the real fun begins! All the work up until now isn’t just busy work or running a timer to bill the client. Each project is unique, but if you’ve done a little legwork up front and have some research and information to start with, everything else becomes much easier.
