## About this Course
Going from a blank screen to a finished website can be daunting. In this course, you'll learn about the major steps involved in designing websites. We'll learn how to gather information, explore potential concepts, and iterate on a design. By the end, you'll have the foundation you need to continue your design journey.

What you'll learn
* Design discovery
* Design exploration
* Discovery

The early phases of design have many names, but sometimes people call this first chunk the "Discovery" phase because we're trying to find as much information as we can before we start designing something that doesn't actually fit the right needs.

## Setting Goals 5:10

Going from a blank screen to a finished website can be daunting. What's the best way to get started, and what are the rest of the steps involved? Good designers don't immediately start creating color palettes or coding a web page. Instead, they start by learning the goals of the site.

Question Ideas for Stakeholders
* How important is this product launch to the company?
* How does this product connect with the company's brand?
* How does this product relate to other products the company has released in the past?
* What does success look like for this website?
* How is this website different than our competitors?
* What problem is the product solving for customers?
* How would you describe a typical customer?

## Understanding the Audience 3:30

In order to successfully reach the goals you've set for a website, you have to understand the target audience.

## Gathering Content 2:23

Once you've spent time setting goals for the site and gathering information about the target audience, you should collect all of the content you'll need to put together your design.

Vector files are ideal for logos and graphics.

## Extra Credit
Working on your own web project? Try interviewing other people in your organization, or people that may potentially visit your website. Ask them questions about their needs and create a summary of your findings. It might seem a bit strange the first time you do it, but you'll be glad later on when you have notes to help guide your design decisions.

## Exploration
After you've finished gathering information and communicating with stakeholders, you're ready to start exploring potential concepts.

## Defining a Call to Action 1:52

We want to draw attention to the pre-order offer, most likely in the form of a button or a link. This is what's called the call to action, because it's the behavior, or action, that we want to encourage in site visitors.

## Prototyping with Wireframes 3:20

A wireframe is a simple version of the final product. Similar to how buildings are made using a simple blueprint drawing, websites are typically first designed with simple black and white lines that help frame where each piece of content should go.

## Mobile First Design 7:55

While it might be tempting to think about what the site might look like on a desktop, we're going to start with the mobile version first.

## Iterating on a Design 12:23

An iteration is one version of your project, and there will likely be several versions between the start and the final product. When creating a design, your first idea is almost never your best idea.

## Extra Credit
Up for a challenge? Try taking the wireframes from this course and create two completely new designs using the exiting content. What can you come up with? Then, compare the designs to see which you like best; you might surprise yourself.
