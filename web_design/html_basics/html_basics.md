## Getting Started with HTML
HTML is a markup language the browser uses to present content to users, like text, links, images and more. It's the basic component from which all websites and applications on the web are built.

## What is HTML? 4:06
HTML is understood by all browsers, from browsers on phones, to tablets to desktop computers. That's why every website and web app you use is made using HTML -- it's the language of the web!

## Global Structure of an HTML Document 5:36

Even though most web pages look different from one another, every web page follows a common HTML structure.

## Semantic HTML: <header>, <footer> and <section> 7:29

HTML's role in web design and development is to provide structure and meaning to content. In this video, you'll begin learning HTML's set of elements that describe sections of content.

## Sectioning Content with <article>, <nav> and <aside> 4:23

Let's continue organizing & structuring our content into logical bits, using HTML's content sectioning elements. In this video, you'll learn how to use the <article>, <nav>, and <aside> tags in your projects.

* <aside> – MDN

## Structuring Content Challenge 4 objectives

## Marking Up a Blog Post 6:33

Let's create a new page (a blog post) for the site. In the process, you'll use most of the HTML tags you've learned to mark up the content in a semantic way.

## Grouping Content with <main> and <div> 6:47

The <main> element represents the main content inside the body of the page, and <div> is a generic container that groups content.

* <main> – MDN
* <div> – MDN
* <blockquote> – MDN
* <cite> – MDN
* <footer> – MDN

## Grouping Content Challenge 3 objectives

## Using Multiple <header> and <footer> Elements 3:51

You can use multiple <footer> and <header> elements in one page. You nest footers inside other elements to contain footer information for that section of the page. Nested headers represent introductory content for a section of the page.

Root-relative paths are commonly used when building and testing sites directly on the web or on a local web server.

Start a Simple Web Server from Any Directory on Your Computer
Open your Terminal (or console), navigate to the directory you want to use and enter the following command:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

You can view your site at this address: localhost:8000.

## HTML Entities and Reserved Characters 4:36
Certain characters are reserved for use in HTML code only. If you use reserved characters in your content, the browser will interpret them as HTML code, and the characters will not appear in your content as expected.

```
<pre>
  &lt;div&gt;
    This is a div...
    &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is nested&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;          
</pre>
```
