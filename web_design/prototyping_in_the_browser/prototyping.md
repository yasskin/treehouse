# Prototyping in the Browser
### 59-minute Design Course

## About this Course
Before you design a website, it's important to have some kind of a plan or a wireframe to guide your efforts. But sometimes when you go from a simple sketch to digital pixels, the results aren't exactly what you expect. When you work with real HTML and CSS, and you're able to see your site on a real screens, you're able to see a more accurate representation of the final result. In this course, we're going to build a website prototype using the Bootstrap web framework.

## What you'll learn
* Prototyping with Bootstrap
* Blocking Content
* Design Patterns
* Fonts and Colors

# Page Layout
A webpage doesn't always translate perfectly from a wireframe to the browser. Sometimes proportions or responsive sizes can be different than you expect. We're going to take a wireframe and turn it into code using Bootstrap.

## Why Prototype in a Browser? 2:59

When you work with real HTML and CSS, and you're able to see your site on a real screens, you're able to see a more accurate representation of the final result. In this course, we're going to start with a wireframe for a profile page on a new social network for designers. We'll create a HTML and CSS prototype using the Bootstrap web framework. That way, we'll have an actual web page we can preview and interact with in a web browser.

* Bootstrap - If you haven't already, take some time to browse the Bootstrap website and the documentation.

## HTML Structure 6:10

Using our mockup, let's start blocking out the major content areas for the mobile and desktop layouts. Using Bootstrap, we can do a lot of the work for both layouts in parallel, which is one of the big advantages of using a front-end framework.

## The Profile Section and Image Gallery 6:29

Next, let's work on the HTML for the profile section and the image gallery.

## Defining Content Areas 8:29

The HTML is just the beginning. Now we're going to use CSS to appropriately size and space content so that it's proportional in the design.

# Design Patterns
Many design problems share the same characteristics, so premade components and ideas - sometimes called "design patterns" - can be used to create a user experience that is consistent and familiar.

## Solutions to Common Design Problems 3:28

When you're browsing the web, often you'll come across design elements that are similar to many other websites you've seen before. The same design solutions appear over and over again because designers face the same types of problems over and over again.

## Creating a Flexible Image Gallery 10:35

Our page features several images toward the bottom, and one of the most common design patterns used to display a collection of images is a grid of rows and columns, typically called an image gallery. The first image is in the upper left, then subsequent images are presented left to right, and then when there's no more space, the next row begins below the first row.

## Responsive Menus 7:50

There are enough menu items at the top of the page, that the navigation menu breaks down on smaller screens like those on a mobile phone. It'd look better in the menu collapsed neatly when it's at mobile sizes. That way, we can add more menu items in the future without fear of cluttering up the navigation.

## Image Carousels 7:06

Featuring an image at the top of the page helps to call out a designer's best work, but what if they want to feature different types of images? It would be nice if users could show more than one featured image at the top of the page.
