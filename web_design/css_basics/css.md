Text Styles 6:52

Text has a significant effect on how we view a web page. In this video, we'll cover common properties for defining text styles.


text-align
Let's us control the horizontal alignment of text.

text-transform
Changes the case of text – whether it's uppercase, lowercase, or capitalized.

text-decoration
Sets the line decoration of elements. We'll commonly use this property to remove underlines in links.

font-weight
Sets how thick or thin the characters are displayed.

Font Properties 4:57

Like text properties, font properties let us change the appearance of text by assigning a font family, font size, font style, and more.

CSS font stacks are prioritized lists of fonts that the browser will cycle through until it finds a font that is installed on the user’s system.

font-family
Defines a typeface for our text.

font-style
Allows italic or oblique faces to be selected within a font family.
