# AJAX Basics
## 317-minute JavaScript Course

## About this Course

### AJAX is an important front-end web technology that lets JavaScript communicate with a web server. It lets you load new content without leaving the current page, creating a better, faster experience for your web site's visitors. In this course, you'll learn how AJAX works and how you can use JavaScript to communicate with a web server. We'll use plain JavaScript as well as jQuery to create AJAX requests and use the response to dynamically update your web pages. Along the way, you'll build mini-projects to reinforce your learning. We wrap up the course with a small project, showing you how to apply what you've learned to pull images from Flickr and display them on your web site.

## What you'll learn

## AJAX Concepts
* How to use JavaScript to make AJAX requests
* How to use jQuery to make AJAX requests
* How to process JSON with jQuery and JavaScript
* How to use a 3rd party API with AJAX and jQuery

## AJAX Concepts

### You'll learn the basics of AJAX, see how Google, Twitter and Reddit use AJAX to make their sites more responsive and interactive, and master the four steps of an AJAX request.

1. Create an XMLHTTP Request Object
2. Create a callback function.
3. Open a request

## Programming AJAX

### Learn to use callbacks to respond to server responses, how the JSON format works and how to use JavaScript to parse JSON data. Build a simple "employees status" widget for a company intranet.

* 17 steps

## AJAX and APIs

### Learn how an API -- Application Programming Interface -- lets you retrieve information from another web site such as Twitter or Google Maps.
