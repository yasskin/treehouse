Take These Courses First

If you're not comfortable with these topics, you should strongly consider taking these courses first:

Ruby Basics
Ruby Loops
Ruby Objects and Classes
The MVC Pattern

One of the conventions Rails follows is a pattern that's widely used in software development, called "Model, View, Controller", or MVC.

The models write Ruby objects to the database, and read them out again later.
The views show data to users, most often in the form of HTML webpages.
Controllers respond to requests from users, usually by coordinating the model and the view.
