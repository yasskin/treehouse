In this video, we will take a look at the different kind of methods you can use to find an npm package or Node.js module.

There are a number of indicators that you can use to determine which package to use.

    Popularity on npm – the number of downloads
Release Date – the more recent the better
Number of Releases – the more frequent the better
Passing Tests - if there's tests passing
Number of Open Issues – the less the better
Popularity on GitHub – The more Stars, Forks and Watches the better
Number of Contributors on GitHub – more eyes on the code the better
