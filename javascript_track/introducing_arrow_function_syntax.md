About this Workshop

ECMAScript 2015 has been widely adopted by all modern browsers. This means we can use a more concise way to write functions. In this workshop we'll convert some traditional functions into a more modern syntax.

// arrow function
const sayName = () => {
    const message = "My name is " + name;
    console.log(message);
}
