About this Course

Sketch 3 is an easy­ to ­use and powerful digital design tool for the Mac. It is quickly becoming the standard for many digital professionals and agencies because it was specifically made for them and their needs. Sketch can be used to create all manner of stunning digital designs from mobile applications to websites and icons. In this course we will introduce to you the basics of Sketch as well as looking at some of the more advanced features. We will give you the unimpeded confidence to begin creating your own designs regardless if you’re already familiar with other design tools or have never used one before! It is recommended that you purchase Sketch 3 for this course.

1 Introducing Sketch

Start with the basics, answering the question “What is Sketch and where can I get it?”. Once installed, you will get a virtual tour of the app before diving in.

2 Sketch Features

Learn the basic features of Sketch, which act as the foundations of every project. From creating objects, to organizing and laying them out.

3 Exporting Designs

Once you have some designs and objects down on Canvas, you will learn how to get them out of Sketch, and onto your computer or iOS device.

4 Build a Mobile Interface

Now that you are familiar enough with some of the features of Sketch, bring everything you have learned together as well as learning some new and slightly advanced skills as we create a simple mobile interface.

Working with Slices 4:32

Slices are special layers that allow us to export areas on the canvas to files.

Creating Exportable Layers 4:40

Learn the best way to make your layers ready for export.

Export Options

* Size relates to the scale of the slice, makes for designing for multi-resolution displays easier
* Suffix field allows you to add a unique identifier to each size you export
* Format relates to the filetype you can export images as

Previewing Designs on Sketch Mirror 4:48

If you’re designing an app for mobile, then it’s more than likely you will want to view those designs on a mobile device. If you have an iOS device, you can do this with Sketch Mirror.

iOS Mirror is a separate application from Sketch

You can find Sketch Mirror in the iOS App Store.

Creating a Wireframe

Do some real designing in Sketch now that we know how to use the app, by bringing what we’ve learned together as we design two screens of an application’s interface.
